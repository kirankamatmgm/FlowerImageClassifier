We are going to use the [Oxford 102 Flower Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/) by [Nilsback,M-E and Zisserman, A., 2008](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/papers/nilsback08.pdf). A 102 category dataset consisting of 102 flower categories, commonly occuring in the United Kingdom. Each class consists of 40 to 258 images. The images have large scale, pose and light variations.

I got accuracy of 97.84%
